# CodeAlpha_Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower Classification project is a popular beginner-level data science project that involves predicting the species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

üå∏ Project Title:

Iris Flower Classification using Data Science

üìå Objective:

To build a machine learning model that can classify iris flowers into one of three species ‚Äî Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica ‚Äî based on the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)

Sepal Width (cm)

Petal Length (cm)

Petal Width (cm)

üìä Dataset Used:

Iris Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Available in sklearn.datasets

Records: 150 samples (50 per species)

Features: 4 numerical features

Target: Iris species (3 classes)

üîç Steps Involved in the Project:
1. Data Collection

Load the Iris dataset using Python libraries like sklearn, pandas, or seaborn.

2. Data Exploration & Preprocessing

Check for null values or outliers.

Perform summary statistics and correlation analysis.

Label encoding if needed (though labels are often already numerical in this dataset).

3. Data Visualization (EDA)

Use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize:

Pairplots (to see feature relationships)

Histograms

Boxplots

Correlation heatmap

Species-wise distribution

4. Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets (usually 80/20).

Apply machine learning classification algorithms:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Train each model on the training set.

5. Model Evaluation

Use metrics such as:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Compare results of different models to select the best one.

6. Model Deployment (Optional for advanced projects)

Create a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit to predict iris species based on user input.

üß† Skills Demonstrated:

Data Cleaning & Analysis

Feature Engineering

Data Visualization

Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)

Model Evaluation

Basic Deployment (Optional)

‚úÖ Outcome:

A working classification model that predicts the correct iris flower species based on input features with high accuracy, typically over 95%.
